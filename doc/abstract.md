# Ichiban: Modern Imageboard

Ichiban is an imageboard software created with Ruby on Rails, a web framework that emphasises agile development. Similar to a web forum, an imageboard allows users to start threads about any topic they would like to discuss. Users can add pictures to their posts and even run their own board if they would like. Generally speaking, there is no means of registration for regular users. Posting is anonymous by default, though a user can choose a name if they would like. Ichiban is built around the concept that user content is more imporant that the users. Content is fleeting as new threads will eventually "bump" old threads off the board. It is my goal to bring Ichiban to a usable state as defined by the project's README file. Ichiban is currently in production and can be used at majolica.com
